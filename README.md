# 🌐 42 Discovery Web Piscine

Welcome to the **42 Discovery Web Piscine** — a comprehensive journey through the fundamentals and advanced topics of web development, designed by the 42 Network. 

This repository documents my personal progression through each cell, from shell basics to dynamic, interactive web applications.


## 🚀 About This Repository

The **42 Discovery Web Piscine** is an intensive, hands-on program by the 42 Network designed to push you to the edge of your comfort zone — and then beyond.

Here, you don’t just learn to code; you learn to **think, create, and solve** like a true developer.

This repo is a **chronicle of growth**, capturing exercises that evolve from simple shell commands to complex interactive web experiences powered by JavaScript and jQuery.




## 🔍 The Curriculum (Cells)

Each **Cell** focuses on a core layer of the web stack, building up from the operating system to the user interface.

Click on the **Cell Name** to jump directly to the source code and detailed exercises.

| Cell | Focus Area | What You'll Build |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[📂 Cell 00](./cell-00)** | **Shell Basics** | Command-line mastery, file manipulation & scripting logic. |
| **[📂 Cell 01](./cell-01)** | **HTML & CSS Foundations** | Semantic layouts, hyperlinking & asset management. |
| **[📂 Cell 02](./cell-02)** | **Advanced CSS & Interactive UI** | Responsive design, Flexbox grids, & Parallax visual effects. |
| **[📂 Cell 03](./cell-03)** | **JavaScript & jQuery** | Dynamic interfaces, user interaction, and state management. |

Every folder is a **mini-portfolio** showcasing clean, semantic code and thoughtful UI/UX decisions.


## 🎯 Navigation Protocol

This repository features a **Fractal Documentation Structure**.

1.  **Global Overview:** This README provides the high-level roadmap.
2.  **Deep Dive:** Inside every **Cell folder**, you will find a dedicated `README.md`.
    * *These internal guides contain specific instructions, technical breakdowns, and the logic behind each exercise.*

### 🚀 Execution Mode
* **💻 For Cell 00 (Shell):** Open your terminal and run the scripts directly.
* **🌍 For Cell 01-03 (Web):** Locate the `.html` files and open them in your browser (Chrome/Firefox) to render the visual experience.

<br>

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Start with **Cell 00** and progress linearly. The difficulty curve is designed to layer concepts on top of each other.
