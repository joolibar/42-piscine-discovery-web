# 🌐 42 Discovery Web Piscine

Welcome to the **42 Discovery Web Piscine** — a comprehensive journey through the fundamentals and advanced topics of web development, designed by the 42 Network. 

This repository documents my personal progression through each cell, from shell basics to dynamic, interactive web applications.

## 🚀 About This Repository

The **42 Discovery Web Piscine** is an intensive, hands-on program by the 42 Network designed to push you to the edge of your comfort zone — and then beyond.

Here, you don’t just learn to code; you learn to **think, create, and solve** like a true developer.

This repo is a **chronicle of growth**, capturing exercises that evolve from simple shell commands to complex interactive web experiences powered by JavaScript and jQuery.
